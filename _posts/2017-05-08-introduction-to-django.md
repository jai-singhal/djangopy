Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a high-level Python Web Framework which is absolutely free and open source. Django encourages rapid development, clean and pragmatic design, it also emphasis on the principle of don't repeat yourself, and reusability of code.

Making your own website is an ambitious goal nowadays and one should choose a framework which is more robust, less time-consuming, secure website and Django serves the programmer to produce robust, secure and bug-free code quickly.

What is Django?
Django is extremely powerful, popular and fully featured server side web framework which is written on top of the Python Language. Django follows Model-Template-View(MVT) architectural pattern. Django is maintained by Django Software Foundation(DSF) which is independent foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

For making a website fully functional you need to make both Backend(server side) and Frontend(client side) strong. In Backend(server side), we concern of manipulating the data. Back end is the scripts and database interaction that actually process the data. As Django is server side framework, we here focus on serving the data manipulation to the Frontend. Now we know that Django is built with Python, which is most intelligible and easy to learn Programming Language, both Django and Python hide the enormous number of power and functionality within it that will make the same application in less time and effort as compared to other languages. On the other side, the front end is what the user directly interacts with the user. So front-end in web development generally means the actual HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.  

Why Django?
Python comes with other great libraries for numerous fields such as Machine Learning, Web Scrapping, Data Mining etc, that can use with your Django Project. You can use Django as an interface to show up your work in a cool way. The Top 5 reason that you should choose Django as your server side web framework.

##### 1. Ridiculously fast.

Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

##### 2. Fully loaded.

Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

##### 3. Reassuringly secure.

Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

##### 4. Exceedingly scalable.

Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

##### 5. Incredibly versatile.

Companies, organizations, and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

### History of Django
Django was born in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. It was released publicly under a BSD License in July 2005. From the day after release, there is a rapid development of the framework being done by the community of Django. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt.

Requirement of Programming knowledge
As discussed above, To develop the Django-powered site, you have to write python code, so you should need some basic knowledge of Python Language. The knowledge about variables, data structures(list, tuple, dictionaries), if-else, for-while loops, functions, class, exception handling etc. Also, basic knowledge of some of the python modules/packages such as os(operating system), re(regular expression), etc will be helpful. The basic knowledge of web development is you may except, very helpful.

Also as far as the database is concerned, you should have some basic touch up knowledge about Database management concept such as about tables, primary key, foreign key, fields etc. Though it is not prior, but it will increase the grasp over the things actually work in Django.
